# security-automation

### Outline for developing a security automation project that includes vulnerability scanning, code analysis, and automated security checks.

1. Environment Configuration:
    - Programming language: mostly bash

2. Static Code Analysis:
    - Add a static code analysis tool like SonarQube, ESLint etc. (min 2 tools)
    - Allow users to configure these tools for security vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues.
    - Generate and store reports.

3. Vulnerability Scanning:
    - Integrate a security scanner like OWASP ZAP, Nessus, trivy etc. (min 2 tools)
    - Configure the scanner to perform automated vulnerability scans on your application or infrastructure.
    - Define scan configurations such as target URLs, authentication, scan policies etc.
    - Script to trigger vulnerability scans and retrieve scan results.


4. Reporting and Notifications:
    - Mechanism to export and send the reports, such as sending email notifications, uploading via http calls etc.


5. Documentation and Readme:
    - Document the setup instructions, usage, and configuration details.


6. Usability:
    - End User will write a single yaml to configure all above tools


Todo: Also check for tools for checking insecure dependencies or misconfigured security settings etc.
also check for opa integration
